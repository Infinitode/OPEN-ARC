# Project 10: MCM

This challenge involves handling a lot of categorical variables, and encoding them in a way for the model to understand. You must also create

---

### The Challenge:
Predict traffic accidents based on certain features.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[Mushroom Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-10-mcm.ipynb)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
