# Project 1: LCSC

We're tackling the medical world head-on with our first challenge. The goal is to create an experimental AI model that can assist medical experts in quickly assessing the state of patients with liver cirrhosis.

---

### The Challenge:
Create and train an AI model that can accurately classify a patient's stage of liver cirrhosis given feature values.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[Liver Cirrhosis Stage Classification ðŸ©º](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadarshvelu/liver-cirrhosis-stage-classification)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-1-lcsc.ipynb)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
