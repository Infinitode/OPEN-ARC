# Project 6: NHG

This challenge involves using either your own models, or using pre-trained models, to accurately summarize a text passage, into a clean and eye-catching headline. After training, use your favorite library to calculate the `average BLEU-Score`, based on the validation set (we used DupliPy, since it's our own package).

---

### The Challenge:
Generate convincing news headlines based on short passages of text.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[NEWS SUMMARY](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunnysai12345/news-summary)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-6-nhg.ipynb)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
