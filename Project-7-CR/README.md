# Project 7: CR

This challenge involves encoding the target class into numerical format, preprocessing the data, and training a classification model, to recommend the best crop, for the given soil content, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.

---

### The Challenge:
Recommend crops based on a given set of features to optimize crop yields.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varshitanalluri/crop-recommendation-dataset)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-7-cr.ipynb)

*Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.*

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
