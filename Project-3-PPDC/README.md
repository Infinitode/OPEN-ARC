# Project 3: PPDC

This challenge involves handling unbalanced data, among other challenges. The goal is to determine which potato plant leaves are healthy, or which leaves have disease. This will help farmers in the agricultural industry to yield healthier harvests and quickly identify unhealthy plants.

---

### The Challenge:
Create and train an AI model, capable of determining the type of potato plant disease, based on vision data.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[🌱 Potato Plant Diseases Data 🍂](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hafiznouman786/potato-plant-diseases-data)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-3-ppdc.ipynb)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
