# Project 5: TWNG

This challenge is a bit different from our usual challenges. This challenge requires you to create a Terraria weapon name generation model, based on weapon names from the official game. It involves data pre-processing, and a bit of iterative testing to create the best model for the dataset.

---

### The Challenge:
Generate Terraria weapon names based on weapon names from the official game.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[All Terraria Weapons DPS V_1.4.4.9](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/acr1209/all-terraria-weapons-dps-v-1449)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-5-twng.ipynb)
- This project also includes pre-trained model weights, along with the `sentencepiece` `.model.` and `.vocab` files used in our pre-processing step.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
