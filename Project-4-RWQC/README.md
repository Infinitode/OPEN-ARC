# Project 4: RWQC

This challenge requires you to experiment with different preprocessing steps, such as balancing using SMOTE, removing outliers, and handling scaling of the data. You would also have to try out different model architectures and parameters for the best performance.

---

### The Challenge:
Create and train an AI model, capable of classifying the quality of a certain red wine, based on 11 different features of sensory data.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-4-rwqc.ipynb)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
