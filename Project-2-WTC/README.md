# Project 2: WTC

This challenge involves handling outliers, and different types of data. The goal is to determine the type of weather based on several factors like: wind speed, humidity, and even location. Note that this dataset is a synthetic dataset, and will not yield accurate real-world results.

---

### The Challenge:
Create and train an AI model, capable of determining the type of weather based on certain features.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[Weather Type Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/weather-type-classification)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-2-wtc.ipynb)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
