# Project 8: PSPM

This challenge involves working with a dataset, where not all features are necessary. You will also have to encode your categorical labels, and run test predictions on your model.

---

### The Challenge:
Predict a plant's stress level based on certain features.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[Plant-Health-Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/plant-health-data)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](project-8-pspm.ipynb)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
