# Project 12:

This challenge involves creating a model that can accurately classify a given raw text email or SMS message into two classes: `spam` or `ham`.

---

### The Challenge:
Classify mail into spam or ham.

### The Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: 
[Spam Mail Classifier Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mosapabdelghany/spam-mail-classifier/)

### Basic Implementation:
We have covered the basic implementation of the model and its code in our notebook, which you can directly run on Kaggle, Colab, or in a local Jupyter environment.

- Link to implementation: [Notebook](notebook.ipynb)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that when not running on Kaggle, you must obtain the dataset either from Kaggle imports, downloads, or other sources.

**Beginners are welcome** to play around with values and parameters for their own implementation. Have fun experimenting!

### Collaboration:
Users can submit their own implementations, improve other users' code, or start from our basic code implementations. We encourage questions about implementations or code, and we promote discussions about model types, parameters, and other related topics.

This is where the community will shine.
